# covi_19

*Covi19* is a free and open-source Covid-19 tracking application.

Inspired by the amazing news that the Slovenian government is most likely gonna accept one of four offers for development of a Covid-19 tracking application, with estimated costs ranging [between 4000 and 48,000 EUR](https://www.rtvslo.si/slovenija/stiri-ponudbe-za-aplikacijo-covid-19-cene-od-4000-do-skoraj-48-000-evrov/530820), I'm developing this thing for free, just to show how much can be done for a much lower price (aka, no price at all). Basically, this app is a parody. I'm using [free API](https://covid19api.com/) for data on the Coronavirus.

**Serious note:** citizens of Republic of Slovenia should consult the [official government site](https://www.gov.si/en/topics/coronavirus-disease-covid-19/coronavirus-symptoms-of-infection-and-treatment/) for information related to Coronavirus.

## What is it built with?

This is a cross-platform Flutter application with support for web (although design for web is not my primary concern at the moment, but who cares, just for a good banter).

Install necessary dependencies with `flutter pub get`, choose the target device and run the app with `flutter run`.
